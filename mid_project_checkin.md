# Mid Project Check In

## Dataset
Cross sectional MRI brain image data from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)

## Team
Wilson Tang and Yuzhong Huang

## Project Description
Healthcare is an ever evolving field and medical imaging is an essential tool for diagnosing and assessing various conditions from neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s to characterizing overall health based on factors like brain volume. Developing tools to better 

## Current Status
At this point in the project we done data exploration on the results and made decisions about what data we want to predict and show (Data exploration notebook, created an automated data extraction and evaluation code(movie file bash), and have created and trained a convulutional neural network(multiple classes)

## MVP by next friday @Mid Project Check-in

We will create a basic visualization tool that can create a virtual brain MRI image based chosen age, nWBV, gender and other attributes that will also display information (either in pygames or website)

## Stretch Goals @Mid Project Check-in

We will attempt to add another tool to assess an image the user inputs and plot their data against our distribution or put the visualization tool on a website
